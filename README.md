Overall, I would say that I enjoyed making this lab. My application purpose for this lab was the map the amount of disc golf courses in each state in the United States. The data I collected from the map came from Udisc.com, which is the primary website/applicated used by disc golfers to track their scores for each round they play. The app has an interactive course map which shows all disc golf courses available for players, from public to private courses to 9 hole and 27 hole courses. I decided to go with the circle map instead of the choropleth map, as I felt the amount of courses in each state would be better represented by a circle relative to size than a diffrerent color. I would say that getting the circles to appear with the mouseover function as a different color was the easy part. I spent more time trying to make the circles relative in size to each other based in the number of courses. It was tougher to figure out the minimum value to use, then on top of that the radius size for each circle relative to the next. In the end, I ended up using a minimun value of 6, and a mimiumum circle radius of 5.
